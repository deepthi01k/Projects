1. The MTB pipeline is an automated Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) system for mapping, variant calling, and identifying resistance-mediating and phylogenetic variants from the whole genome sequence data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates derived from patient sputum DNA samples using Illumina technology.
It is written in Python as well as BASH script and is run in a LINUX environment.
The program takes as input the following: the path to the folder containing Fastq.gz files, Mutation Catalogue and the Reference FASTA file.
This code works in batch mode as well as with single mode.
